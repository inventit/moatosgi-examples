Example modules for MOAT OSGi API
=================

This project introduces source code examples using [MOAT OSGi](http://inventit.edicy.co/guides/moat-iot/moat-osgi-gateway) API, a part of [MOAT IoT](http://inventit.edicy.co/guides/moat-iot).

You can build each project with [Maven2](http://maven.apache.org/). The built jar is an OSGi bundle so that you can deploy it onto an OSGi container.

Note that the bundle is depending on a bundle exporting MOAT OSGi API.

## How to build

<pre>
  mvn clean install
</pre>

You can find the generated jar files in ./target directory.
